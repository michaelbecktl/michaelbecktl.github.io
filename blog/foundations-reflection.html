      <h3>
        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the Human Skills learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        One of the few things I've learned about myself through our journey
        through human skills, is how my personal values have stuck with me
        throughout a majority of my adult life. These values have been the
        foundation to how I behave, learn, and grow as an individual. With the
        base of those foundations, I've also learned about how emotional
        intelligence relates around my life and how it affects my growth and
        interactions with my former colleagues. Throughout my foundations
        learning journey, I've definitely felt imposter's syndrome very often
        when faced with difficulties during some of the tech sections. I've only
        become more determined to make sure I don't feel that way again.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I feel that having values gives you a foundation to have a condusive
        mindset in learning new things and as an overall improve our own
        performance and capabilities in anything, including programming. Empathy
        and self-awareness is key in developing patience in not just another but
        with ourselves when reflecting on work and progress.
      </p>
      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
      <p>
        While I've understood mostly that human skills is related to our own
        behaviours and how we interact with others in daily lives and in
        workspaces, I would not have imagined diving deep into aspects like
        mindfulness and neuroplasticity. While it hasn't really struck me
        entirely, I can see how it plays it's role in the future.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I think the most challenging thing is not understanding Human Skills,
        but actually learning to implement them proactively into our work. As we
        age we tend to not stray away from routine and our behavioral norms, but
        as with neuroplasticity, we can change if we work on it and believe
        there's always room for improvement.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Technical skills are important to any job industry, but I've always felt
        that human skills were something that was ignored in past decades. In
        the present age, human skills are becoming more of an important factor
        in hiring employees. These human skills are also benefictial in learning
        the actual tech itself as it teaches us to pace ourselves and set up a
        healthy learning plan.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
        waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
        programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I don't feel like the time spent studying Human Skills was a waste of
        time. Admittedly, I have screened past the human skills sections in a
        short time though not because I didn't care about them, but the sections
        were fairly straightforward and as long as I understand the concept of
        what was taught, I felt like I good move forward. With that said, the
        time spent on human skills wasn't too much, and I felt a good balance of
        it compared to the time spent on learning tech sections.
