  <h2>CSS Concept - Positions</h2>
  <p>
    Using CSS, we can manipulate the placement of things using the position
    code. To the right are examples of codes and two separate elements when
    placed down normally. (They have been coloured and scaled down for easy
    visuals). Contents in a webpage are shaped into boxes, and the red and blue
    colored squares represent two contents. <br />
    <br />
  </p>
  <div class="flex-container" id="border">
    <div>
      <h3>position: static</h3>
      The first example, we have set these elements into "static" position. The
      static position anchors the element into it's specific spot on the
      webpage. This is the default settings for all CSS elements, but I've
      included it for clarity. Notice I've also left a code comment that says
      "top: 50px", this is suppose to move the red square down, but because the
      position is static, theoretically this code does nothing. The squares
      remain in their individual placements and do not collide with each other.

      />
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="redbox" id="static">Static!</p>
      <p class="bluebox" id="static"></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div class="flex-container" id="border">
    <div id="grow4">
      <h3>position: relative</h3>
      For elements that have a relative position, they are nearly the same as
      static positions except when given certain rules or code, their content
      can be moved from their placement. <br />
      <br />
      Not to be confused with actually relocating them, on the contrary, based
      on rules given to them, their content are moved <i>relative</i> to their
      original position! The red box labelled "relative" on the right, their
      placement is still anchored to the same spot just like the red box
      labelled "static" on the left. But when given the "top: 50px;" rule, I've
      displaced the content 50 pixels from the top, which allowed it to overlap
      with the blue box below!
    </div>
    <div>
      <img
        src="screenshots/htmlcss2.jpg"
        alt="Code Sample for Relative Position"
      />
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="redbox" id="relative">Relative!</p>
      <p class="bluebox"></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div class="flex-container" id="border">
    <div id="grow4">
      <h3>position: absolute</h3>
      Elements that have been tagged with the "absolute" position, will attach
      themselves to another element. That said element would have to be an
      element that also has a positioned set. What this means is if we gave the
      red box an absolute position, and then put it in within the blue box. It
      would sit on top of the blue box instead of taking the next space
      available like the previous examples. <br />
      <br />
      In the example code on the right, in HTML and in CSS, the red box div is
      set within the blue box div. The blue box div is also given a relative
      position to make sure the other box's absolute position can trigger. We've
      also set it so that the red box will sit on the bottom left corner.

        class="biggerimg"
      />
    </div>
    <div>
      <div class="bluebox" id="parent">
        <div class="redbox" id="child">Absolute!</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div class="flex-container" id="border">
    <div id="grow4">
      <h3>position: fixed</h3>
      For any elements attached with the fixed positioning, their position is
      not tied to the webpage, but rather on your screen. You'll notice by now
      there's a pink circle on the bottom left labelled "Fixed!". That pink
      circle is not going anywhere no matter what you do! <br />
      <br />
      Referring to the sample code on the right, I've also added a bottom and
      right code pinpoint where exactly I want it to stay.

    <div>
      <div class="pinkcircle" id="fixed">Fixed!</div>
      <div class="hidden"></div>
