      <h3>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I'm not sure what kind of situation I would use as an example, as I
        don't feel like I've made a big ethical decision. When I was still
        studying Cookery in New Zealand, there was an assignment that we worked
        on that was relatively difficult for some of my classmates. A friend had
        then approached me and asked for guidance with his work, but I was
        unfortunately occupied with family matters at the time. He asked me if
        he could look at my work and perhaps get some idea on how to work around
        it. Trusting him, I sent him a copy of my work. Funny enough, I even
        said "Don't copy my stuff yeah", which he just say "yeah, of course".
        <br />
        <br />Not surprisingly, the next day our tutor called on me for
        plagiarism and I had to re-do my work while he did not have to. Looking
        back at the situation, it was obviously unfair that I was the one that
        had to start over. Thinking deeply, the tutor would've known my work was
        the original, and this was a lesson on having some integrity and not
        handing over your work to someone else. The more I think about it, I've
        made the wrong decision and perhaps "not" helping someone sometimes,
        could actually help them to grow into learning how to self-develop than
        relying on others.

      <h3>
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I was born in Malaysia, and my cultural background is Chinese. Having
        three older brothers that have shaped my life revolving around
        old-fashioned values, which I still hold true to today. Family has been
        the center of my life for most of what I could remember, no matter how
        far off we stray or how occupied we are with our personal schedule,
        there was always time to spend with family and we appreciate the small
        moments we have together in recent days. <br /><br />Being was raised in
        a multiracial environment, I was surrounded by many different people and
        culture, we've learned to be respectful towards one another regardless
        of how different people are. As I myself had learnt to speak in English,
        Malay and Cantonese, the nuance in languages and also exposure to
        different people. With learning multiple languages, not everyone
        including myself could be a completely fluent bilingual or trilingual,
        this had molded me to try and understand people between the lines rather
        than the face value of their speech. I'd actually find myself
        misunderstanding friends and strangers a lot when I was younger, despite
        knowing the language, I found myself in a language barrier! "Why?" I
        thought, it was only as I graduated from high-school that I have learned
        to keep an open-mind, as expression is not necessary well-formed in
        speech and sentences, but it is from the heart.

      <h3>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I am a very consistent and persistent person when it comes to learning
        and progression, which enables me to face challenges comfortably and if
        anything; enjoy them. Throughout my 11 years experience as a Chef, I've
        grown used to high-pressure environments and have gained the ability to
        lead and problem-solve in a calm and organized demeanor. This would help
        me in planning my learning journey in complicated obstacles and finding
        alternatives methods to resolving issues.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h3>
      <p>
        While I think I am a very patient person in general circumstances, when
        it comes to progression and self-development, I tend to be very
        impatient. While this does not necessarily translate to prefer quicker
        methods in learning things, I may tend to miss out details when reading
        through materials.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h3>
      <p>
        There was a time when the team leader of another department was
        constantly berating her team members, decreasing overall team morale
        over miniscule detail. The department was very closely related to mine
        and eventually the tension had seeped into my team especially during
        times when I was absent. The overall productivity as a result of this
        tension had been poor between both our teams, so I looked into resolving
        the matter. First, I had to identify what is the cause of the other
        leader's behaviour and tried to assess what had prompted her verbally
        aggressive behaviour onto her team. I gathered testimony from both the
        leader and employees that had worked with her, then closely monitored
        the workflow on subsequent days. In the end, I found that the leader's
        behaviour was without reasonable means and has been emotionally
        unstable. <br /><br />I've tried to confront her and teach her
        alternative methods to lead or train her team, then was responded with
        claims that her team members were incompetent, but she would try her
        best to calm down. As time gradually passed, I saw no improvement in the
        team synergy and her leadership, I had no choice but to submit a report
        to the Human Resource department. Looking back at how I handled the
        situation, I believe it was the most reasonable thing to do at the time.
        However, I thought I should've escalated the matter to management a lot
        sooner rather than taking the slow approach to properly understood the
        issue. As productivity was low and I did not realized how impactful it
        was.
