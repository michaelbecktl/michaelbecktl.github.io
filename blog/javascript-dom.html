        <p>
          Last week, we've been introduced to HTML and CSS. This week, we're
          touching on Javascript, but how is Javascript different from the other
          two languages we have learned? Let's discuss.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML and CSS are codes which basically the builders and designers.
          They make up the core of a webpage, and redecorate to make them pretty
          on the eyes. Javascript however, consists of tools that can help make
          a webpage more interactive. This can range from animations, like
          making buttons do something to parts of the webpage or even changing
          content when being prompted to. Much like the button below this
          paragraph.
        </p>
        <br />
        <div>
          <p id="pushedButton">
            <button id="pushMe">Push Me!</button>
          </p>
        </div>
        <br />
        <h3>Control Flow & Loops</h3>
        <p>
          When we talk about control flow, it is the way a script of code is
          being read. As we learned in HTML and CSS, codes are read from top to
          bottom and executed in order. With codes written at the bottom of a
          script possibly overwriting what's written beforehand. With
          Javascript, we can make use of
          <b>conditionals</b> and <b>loops</b> to change this control flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we set a <b>conditional</b> is set, it allows a function or
          action written in the code script to either perform immediately or to
          wait for a condition to be fulfilled before executing. For example, if
          you wanted to cook dinner, but you had no groceries, your options are
          probably to get some or just order takeout. Let's put this analogy
          example in code:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
      if (groceries === 0) {
        orderTakeout()
        } else {
        makeDinner()
      }
      </code></pre>
        <p>
          Where as for <b>loops</b>, they are functions that allow Javascript to
          execute a certain actions a specified amount of times in a compact
          line of codes. It helps so we don't have to copy and paste certain
          codes all over the script!
        </p>
        <h3>What is a DOM?</h3>
        <p>
          A DOM (Document Object Model) in technical terms is an interface that
          makes up a page, separating it into diferrent sections and
          representing them as "nodes" or "objects". These representations allow
          the page to be manipulated by languages like Javascript. But I don't
          know what these words mean? Our webpage is made out of HTML, the
          browser we use to view the webpage, takes all the HTML and translates
          it into a DOM. The DOM acts like an object that allows Javascript to
          interact with it and change things accordingly. In a way it's an
          interface that lets the two languages co-exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can interact with the DOM using Javascript, which we can use to
          retrieve information or alter codings in a webpage. We can use it to
          find and/or change properties of elements in HTML, or even remove an
          image. DevTools in Google Chrome can also be used to execute these
          codes.Example of such codes are:
        </p>
        <pre><code id="codeSample">
      // Removing this text code sample //
      document.getElementById('codeSample').innerHTML = '&lt;img src="../images/its-gone.gif"&gt;'
      </code></pre>
        <h3>Difference between Arrays and Objects</h3>
        <p>
          An <b>array</b> is like a box of parameters or items that you put
          inside, that are listed in order. The items that are placed inside an
          array are also assigned numbered indexes starting from zero. This
          means if I put an example array like below, apple would be [0] and
          pear would be [2].
        </p>
        <pre><code>
      let fruits = [apple, banana, pear, pineapple]
      </code></pre>
        <p>
          An <b>object</b> can contain properties defined by keys and values
          assigned to them, unlike arrays. This gives objects characteristics
          instead of just being a name. For example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
      let person = {
        name: 'Michael'
        age: 33
        occupation: 'Chef'
      }
      </code></pre>
        <p>
          In short, objects are useful when we need to assign a lot parameters
          into one single item. Where as array is good for listing down items
          and used for grouping. Objects can also be put into arrays if needed.
        </p>
        <h3>Functions</h3>
        <p>
          Functions are a convenient tool in Javascript that lets you do
          multiple lines of coding compacted into one. It essentially like
          "naming" a set of codes which you can then call at anytime to make
          these set of codes happen, without needing to retype the entire thing
          again over multiple occasions.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
          function ateCandy() {
            candyCount--
            document.getElementById('candyCount').innerHTML = 'candyCount'
            alert("You ate a candy!")
        }
      </code></pre>
        <p>
          In the example code above, let's assume there was multiple buttons
          that let's you eat a candy everytime you click it. In order to get
          each button to work the same way, they would all have to include the
          three lines below <code>function ateCandy()</code>. But with
          functions, these three codes have been assigned to the
          <code>ateCandy()</code>, all I have to do is use
          <code>ateCandy()</code> in each button to subsequently activate those
          three lines, without the need to copy paste the entire thing in
          multiple sections!
