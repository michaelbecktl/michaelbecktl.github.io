    <h2 class="pagetitle">Javascript Fundamentals</h2>
    <p>
      Last week, we've been introduced to HTML and CSS. This week, we're
      touching on Javascript, but how is Javascript different from the other two
      languages we have learned? Let's discuss.
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML and CSS are codes which basically the builders and designers. They
      make up the core of a webpage, and redecorate to make them pretty on the
      eyes. Javascript however, consists of tools that can help make a webpage
      more interactive. This can range from animations, like making buttons do
      something to parts of the webpage or even changing content when being
      prompted to. Much like the button below this paragraph.
    </p>
    <br />
    <div>
      <p id="pushedButton">
        <button id="pushMe">Push Me!</button>
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <h3>Control Flow & Loops</h3>
    <p>
      When we talk about control flow, it is the way a script of code is being
      read. As we learned in HTML and CSS, codes are read from top to bottom and
      executed in order. With codes written at the bottom of a script possibly
      overwriting what's written beforehand. With Javascript, we can make use of
      <b>conditionals</b> and <b>loops</b> to change this control flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we set a <b>conditional</b> is set, it allows a function or action
      written in the code script to either perform immediately or to wait for a
      condition to be fulfilled before executing. Where as for <b>loops</b>,
      they are functions that allow Javascript to execute a certain actions a
      specified amount of times in a compact line of codes. It helps so we don't
      have to copy and paste certain codes all over the script!
