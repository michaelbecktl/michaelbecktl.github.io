    <h2 class="pagetitle">My Learning Plan</h2>
    <p>
      My goal is to bridge my career path into the information technology
      sector. I am determined to come out at the end of this course, equipped
      with necessary knowledge and continue in my own self-development in terms
      of human skills and technical skills. I've found myself interested and
      invested in topics I enjoy particularly difficult and challenging ones,
      and these challenges drive me to learn and overcome them.
    </p>
    <p>
      My strength is that I'm fueled by failure and mistakes. Imperfection and
      inconsistency sets me in a path to further improve my skills. In terms of
      limitations, I have a poor attention span if the topic is too lengthy and
      basic, impatience can often times just lead to procrastination or being
      distracted from my own learning plan. I'm also a married man, that wants
      to be able to spend as much time with my spouse as possible, as well as
      putting time into my own personal hobbies. My personal hours being in
      balance keeps me motivated to move forward in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going forward, I hope to learn how to work together with others and
      improve my communication skills and my organization skills. Prior to this
      course, I've often been assigned lead roles without co-leaders or given
      much supervision myself. While I can handle myself, I want to receive more
      exposure when it comes to leading a task side-by-side with others, rather
      than being the one that's always steering the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've set a fixed time to work and study. While I understand the course
      dynamic allows us a flexible schedule, I find it weirdly accommodating
      when I put myself into work/studies at a traditional time schedule. I
      intend to also communicate with others more, and ask more questions or
      advice from fellow peers and facilitators. If in any case, work starts to
      pile up and become difficult, I'm able to prioritize and focus on my task
      while setting a personal deadline. Then if I found myself struggling at a
      certain checkpoint for too long, I'll seek some advice from the
      facilitators or other students on Discord.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope the facilitation team is able to guide me on areas I can personally
      improve in both technical and human skills. while I don't want to receive
      flat-out answers to problems I face, a review or feedback of my work would
      greatly help.
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of time schedule, I'm still currently working at my previous
      workplace as a part-timer. I have officially resigned from my position
      with my last day ending just before bootcamp, so that I can dedicate my
      time into it.
