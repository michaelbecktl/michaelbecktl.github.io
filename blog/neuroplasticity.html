      <h3>
        Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
        people.
      </h3>
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is about how the human brain is able to grow and adapt
        to situations on a daily basis, regardless of a person's age. It isn't
        uncommon for people, particularly adults, that believe they are always
        born with a limit or talent. People tend to believe that they are meant
        for something, while at the same time they are unable to learn about
        things that aren't in their forte. The understanding of neuroplasticity
        shows people that they can learn new things. Understanding that through
        practice, their brain would be able to adapt and learn; people would be
        more encouraged and determined to overcome challenges and keep learning.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for
        your benefit.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I want to attempt more challenges, and keep trying new things.
        Overcoming things and learning how to do it is my method of practice and
        developing neuroplasticity. Practice and repetition is also a great way
        to strengthen memories and understanding of concepts. Essentially,
        sinking time into learning and practice is the best way for me.
      </p>
      <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
      <p>
        Health is important in balance to frequent practice and studying. Taking
        a break once in a while, having proper sleep hours and engaging in
        physical exercise can also help stimulate the brain to adapt.

      <h2 class="pagetitle">Growth Mindset</h2>
      <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
      <p>
        The growth mindset is the thought process and behavioral pattern of an
        individual that reflects their ability and attributes towards learning.
        A person with growth mindset is more likely to take on difficult tasks
        with persistence because of the eagerness to learn. It is directly
        correlated with neuroplasticity, as a person with growth mindset is
        consistently stimulating neuroplasticity.
      </p>
      <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
      <p>
        I've also learned about fixed mindset, and tried to reflect on it's
        common behaviour pattern against my own habits. I think there are
        definitely room for improvements in myself and I'd like to put myself in
        a better growth mindset.
      </p>
      <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
      <p>
        I will set a goal for myself, and challenge myself to get through the
        day at a timely schedule. With habitual learning I believe I can learn
        at a more effective pace.

        Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your
        learning plan and strategy.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I understand that persistence and consistency is key, it's probably one
        of my weakest factor in my learning strategy. I will improve on my
        learning plan with set schedules and goals.
