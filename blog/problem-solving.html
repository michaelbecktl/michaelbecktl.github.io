      <h2 class="pagetitle">Problem Solving</h2>
      <p>
        This week has been a whole lotta Javascript! With introductions to new
        methods and Javascript Katas, I was able to learn a lot of new tools and
        practice them in the Katas. How did it exactly go? One thing for sure,
        there was a lot of problem solving.
      </p>
      <h3>► Act 1: The Simple Problem</h3>
      <p>
        In the 2nd Kata, for "Manipulating Objects", I was stuck at number 8 for
        such a long time. The prompt was:
      </p>
      <pre><code
        >   Add a ben property to the value of the terah children property. ben should be an object with the key name and the value "Ben".</code
      ></pre>
      <p>
        I attempted to do it the same way as I did for Adam in the first part of
        the exercise, which kept crashing the test or returning a result of
        undefined.
      </p>
      <p>
        After trying different codes, I was extremely frustrated and convinced
        that I misunderstood the prompt. When I realised I might've overlooked
        something and decided to go through the Rubber Ducky method. I've taken
        apart the question and decided to tackle it as literal as how it was
        worded, and that was when I realised that the prompt wanted me to issue
        'ben' as a
        <b>property</b>, and not an <b>object</b> like I did with Adam. And that
        'ben' the <b>object</b> was suppose to be the <b>value</b> of Ben.
      </p>
      <p>
        If anything I've learned, its to read the prompt carefully and not
        overthink the solution. Perhaps breaking prompts down into proper
        pseudocodes was a better way to strategize in the future, although to be
        fair, the prompt was very short and straight-forward.
      </p>
      <h3>► Act 2: The Not-So-Simple Problem</h3>
      <p>
        The Super FlipFlop challenge has got to be the most interesting one out
        of all Katas. My initial solution was to run a <b>for.. of</b> loop to
        individually run them through the flipflop() function. The issue is the
        return at the end sometimes did not come in arrays, which fails the
        first prompt and then sometimes it wouldn't only run the function on the
        first item in each array.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did some research on different Javascript methods and loops to find
        out which one was a more suitable line to use. Eventually I settled on
        using the .maps method on a basic loop to be able to flipflop() each
        array. In doing so, I succeeded all the test except the very first test,
        which is that if presented with no parameters, the result should return
        an empty array. I chose to put a conditional where if the
        <code>"parameters &lt; 0"</code>, the return would just be an empty
        array and would not call the flipflop() function.
      </p>
      <h3>► Reflect on problem-solving techniques/processes</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Pseudocode:</b> I've applied a few pseudocodes to help plan out when
        attempting complex prompts, I thought it was really helpful to also just
        pseudocode something that was done and leave aside, while attempting a
        different solution so I wouldn't forget my progress from before. I'm
        confident in my usage of Pseudocodes.<br /><br />
        <b>Trying something:</b> I've went through a lot of trial and errors,
        most of my attempts are looking up new codes and trying them out to see
        what they do and if they work.<br /><br />
        <b>Rubber ducky method:</b> It definitely made a lot of difference to
        look at problems from a smaller part-by-part perspective and get one
        component working before the next. I will probably need to work on
        making this a habit.<br /><br />
        <b>Reading error messages:</b> I'm confident in reading error messages
        and using them to debug issues, they've been guiding my solutions for
        most of it. <br /><br />
        <b>Console.logging:</b> I've still not gotten a good practice of using
        console.logging things until I get stuck. There was one problem where I
        had solved the issue and I forgot to change console.log into return, so
        that was also pretty funny. <br /><br />
        <b>Googling:</b> I probably can't say it enough, but Google has always
        been my source of information before I even started DevAcademy. I find
        it easy to look up solutions that I need with proper search keywords.<br /><br />
        <b>Asking peers/coaches for help:</b> I'll admit I haven't been going to
        anyone for help but I probably should start. I'm been giving myself my
        own timebox to solve a solution, and I would ask someone for help if I
        was unable to complete a task in time. So far, I have been able to
        manage in within my own deadline.<br /><br />
        <b>Improve process with reflection:</b> I'll definitely try to improve
        on my problem-solving process based on today's reflection,
        self-realization is the first step to improvement.
      </p>
      <h3>► Asking for Help</h3>

      <p>
        Being stuck on "manipulating objects" part for a long time was really
        pushing me to ask for help. I was quite reluctant on doing so because I
        was so convinced that it was a simple problem that I couldn't figure
        out. I did however set a deadline for myself, that if I could not solve
        it, I would eventually ask the coaches or homegroup for help.
